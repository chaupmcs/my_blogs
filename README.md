# My blog

A repo to store all the posts for my blogs.

Accidentally I've found [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) quite a good place to share jupyter-notebook for readers. However, when I change the notebook, nbview might need to 10 minutues to update. It can be solved by putting "?flush_cache=true" in the nbviewer url to force it fetch the newest notebook.
