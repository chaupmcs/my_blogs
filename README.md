# My blog

A repo to store all the posts for my blogs.

Accidentally I've found [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) quite a good place to share jupyter-notebook for readers. However, when I change the notebook, nbviewer might need to 10 minutes to update. I realize we can put *?flush_cache=true* at the end of nbviewer url to force it to re-render the notebook page.
